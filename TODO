High priority:
- Fix initialization radius (currently hardcoded in...)

Medium Priority:
- Fix coupling between channel box and external channel walls force (the implementation should be improved)
- Parallelize with OpenMP
- Parallelize with CUDA
- Fix the comments of the different files
- Optimize printing of configurations (files too large...)

Low Priority:
- Parallelize with MPI
- Change OXLOG
- Uniformize code conventions (put functions and variables as snake_case, classes as PascalCase, and macros as UPPERCASE)
