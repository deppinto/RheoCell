High priority:
- Fix periodic neighbour functions: only top, down, left, and right are correctly implemented (in my defense, only these are actually used...currently...)

Medium Priority:
- Fix coupling between channel box and external channel walls force (the implementation should be improved)
- Parallelize with CUDA
- Fix the comments of the different files
- Optimize printing of configurations (files too large...)
- Add get_settings(input) to the fields object
- Technically, LEBc interactions can be merged with normal interactions...

Low Priority:
- Improve parallelization with OpenMP
- Parallelize with MPI
- Change OXLOG
- Uniformize code conventions (put functions and variables as snake_case, classes as PascalCase, and macros as UPPERCASE)
- Implement lattice subdivisions (extra care since this might not interact well with the different objects)
